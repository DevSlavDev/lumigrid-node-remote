# ✨ LumiGrid - Remote Node ✨

---

## 💡 What is this Node?

The Remote Node is your tactile interface to the LumiGrid system! 🎛️👆 This ESP32-based node provides a physical control point with a touchscreen and rotary encoders to command selected devices on your network without needing a phone or computer.

Developed with passion by **DevSlavDev** 👨‍💻 in collaboration with **Cube & Reclame Fabriek** 🏢.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Physical Control Interface:** Dedicated hardware controls for reliable interaction.
* **Touchscreen Display:** A small display for navigating menus, selecting devices, and viewing status. 🖼️
* **Rotary Encoders:** Two encoders for intuitive adjustment of parameters (like brightness, speed, color values). 🎛️🎛️
* **Network Control:** Communicates over the network to control other LumiGrid nodes via their APIs. ➡️ nodes
* **Custom UI:** A user interface specifically designed for the touchscreen, based on the main Web UI look and feel.
* **Control Modes:** Primarily operates as an Independent node, sending commands based on user input. 🚶
* **Calendar-Based Functionality:** Equipped with an RTC for potential time-based actions or displays on the remote itself. 🗓️
* **REST API & Web UI (Limited):** Primarily for configuration and status, not daily operation. 🌐

## 🚧 Work In Progress (WIP)! 🚧

This node is currently under active development planning. 🌱 The focus will be on designing and implementing the intuitive touchscreen UI and the logic for discovering and controlling other nodes.

Development of this node will follow after the core ESP32 nodes are functional.

## 🤝 Contributions

Currently, contributions are not being actively accepted for this specific node. We are focusing on building the core system structure.

**HOWEVER!** We are building this with future collaboration in mind! 🎉 Once the main code is complete and stable, we plan to open up contributions. Keep an eye on the main LumiGrid repository for updates! 👀
